 * dependency depth — what has to happen first is on the left — and top to bottom
 * by urgency, which is the priority a task inherits from whatever is waiting on
 * it (see urgencies()). So the important work is along the top, and so is
 * everything it needs, in the order it needs it: a P1 five prerequisites deep
 * drags the whole chain up with it rather than sitting above unrelated work.
 *
 * Within one band of equal urgency, a task follows its prerequisites — it lands
 * level with the average row of what it waits on, which keeps a chain running
 * straight across instead of stitching between rows. Columns are laid out left
 * to right so that pull always reads positions that are already decided.

/**
 * The order the keyboard walks the board: downstream, left to right.
 *
 * Pressing on from a task goes to what waits on it, because following an arrow
 * forwards is reading the plan in the direction the work runs. So a chain is
 * walked end to end before the next one starts, rather than the walk dropping
 * down a column and leaving you to find where the arrow went. Where a task has
 * several dependents the topmost is taken first, and chains are started from the
 * far left — the same order the board is drawn in, so the walk is the thing you
 * are looking at and not a second order kept behind it.
 *
 * Every task appears exactly once. One with two prerequisites belongs to
 * whichever chain reaches it first; anything a cycle keeps out of the walk is
 * picked up at the end, because unreachable by keyboard is worse than out of
 * order.
