 * Where to draw each task, given where the layout says it belongs.
 *
 * The layout is a pure function of the graph, so every edit hands the canvas a
 * whole new set of positions at once; this is what stops that being a jump cut.
 * It tweens rather than handing the job to CSS because the arrows have to arrive
 * with the nodes — an SVG path can't transition, so every frame is a render and
 * the edges are drawn from the same in-between positions the nodes are.
 *
 * New positions are taken up during the render that brings them, not in the
 * effect that follows it: a task carries on being drawn where it already was,
 * and the tween moves it from there. Do it in the effect and the first frame
 * paints the destination before the animation has anything to say, which is a
 * jump cut with a slide after it.
 *
 * So a task seen for the first time is not animated — it simply appears where it
 * belongs, because a new node sliding in from wherever the last one was is a lie
 * about what just happened. Re-targeting mid-flight is free: the next tween
 * starts from wherever the node has got to, so a second edit during the first
 * second bends the path instead of restarting it.
